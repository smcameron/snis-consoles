<h2 align=center>SNIS console Notes</h2>
<p>The basic idea is that we can run many (but not all) of the Space Nerds in Space
bridge stations on
a Raspberry Pi, and have an arduino connected to the Pi, and connected to the arduino
can be a load of potentiometers and switches and LEDs.  These potentiometers and
switches can be logically connnected to buttons and sliders within the game.  The arduino
can poll the state of the switches and potentiometers and report changes to the game
via the USB serial back to a process on the the raspberry pi which can then feed these
changes into the game via the interface provided by
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/snis-device-io.h">snis-device-io.h</a>.
Likewise, LEDS for warning lights, etc. can be controlled from the game via USB serial to
to the arduino.  In this way we can build a physical console for each of the stations to
make the game seem a little more like a spaceship and little less like a computer game.

<p>Why Arduino?  Because arduino is accessible and open source.  It's possible other
people besides me may want to build something like this, and Arduino is the easiest,
most well-known and popular thing in its class, and most likely to be something that
other people will be <em>able</em> to work with.

Up to recently, I had been planning to use serial port over USB to communicate between the computer
(e.g. Raspberry Pi 4) and the Arduino, mainly because doing that is easy.  However, this makes the
host computer side more complicated.  I need a little program that reads input from the serial port,
sends messages to turn on LEDs, and communicates with snis_client via a unix domain socket.  Doable,
but maybe more of a pain in the ass than is strictly necessary.

<p>What if the whole thing shows up as a USB game controller?  I already have support in snis_client
for customizable game controller setups, so if possible, that seems like a win.

<p>I do have some concerns though.  Game controllers
have "buttons" and "axes".  The send "button up" and "button down" events to the host, and axis
movement events (e.g. digitized potentiometer voltage readings).  However, a toggle switch isn't
so easily modelled.  Maybe a "button down + button up" event for "on", and a "button up" event
for off could work?  And what about controlling LEDs?  Not sure how that is done.
If these can be solved, then a USB game controller would require much less work on the software
end of things, I think.  Also, I was thinking about making some dial gauges with servos or
stepper motors, and those would need to be controlled somehow. I don't think game controllers
have any such capabilities.

<p>Hmm, SDL2 has:

<blockquote>
<pre>
int SDL_GameControllerSetLED(SDL_GameController *gamecontroller, Uint8 red, Uint8 green, Uint8 blue);

gamecontroller    The controller to update
           red    The intensity of the red LED
         green    The intensity of the green LED
          blue    The intensity of the blue LED
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So... gamecontrollers only have one LED, and it's an RGB LED and all you can do is set the color?
That's not really going to work.

<p>One of the things which has been holding up this SNIS Consoles projects is that I didn't have
a good idea about how to physically build the control panel surface that I found entirely satisfactory.
<p>The "professional" way to do it is to get some sheet steel or aluminum and cut and drill holes of the
right sizes and shapes, deburr, powder coat, and screw all the components (potentiometers, switches, faders, etc.)
into the panel.  That gets expensive real quick.  If you're Mr. Behringer, and you have a load of factories in China,
that's no problem, but I'm just a guy, I don't even have a garage.  A cheaper and easier way that is common among hobbyists is to laser
cut acrylic sheets and use that instead of steel or aluminum.  But for me, there are a few of problems with this.  First, it
has a certain look.  Perfect if you're going for a Star Trek LCARS styel panel, but that's not what I'm going for.
I'm going for something a little more "Apollo capsule", or "fighter jet cockpit".
Second, if the panel is thin enough to mount inexpensive potentiometers and it is large, it might flex too
much. This can be mitigated by gluing beams of reinforcement webbing on the underside of the panel though. Finally,
while acrylic initially looks great (if that's the look you're going for) it has a tendency to get scratched up over
time, especially for something that is hands-on, like a control panel.

<p>But now I think I have come up with a method that should be inexpensive, durable, easy, good looking
(with some paint), and did I mention inexpensive?

<p>Here's the idea: Make the panel out of thin plywood.  Cut out large
rectangular holes for panel inserts.  Mount the hardware (pots, switches,
faders, etc) to the panel inserts with a laser cutter.  Finally, make the panel
inserts by <em>3D printing them</em>.  That's right, 3D printing.  Doing it
this way, the panel and inserts are practically free (assuming you have access
to a 3D printer and a laser cutter, which if you're in a reasonably large city
with a makerspace, you probably do have such access.)

<p>Here are a couple prototype panel inserts I printed yesterday, one to hold a couple 60mm faders
and one to hold a potentiometer. They feel pretty sturdy.
<p align=center><img src="prototype-panel-inserts-front.jpg" alt="Prototype panel insert, front">
<p align=center>Prototype panel insert, front
<p align=center><img src="prototype-panel-inserts-back.jpg" alt="Prototype panel insert, back">
<p align=center>Prototype panel insert, back
<p>No dimensions on a 3D print survive first plastic, and these are no exceptions.  The hole
for the potentiometer is slightly too small, and the face plate is a little too thick, and
the screw holes for the faders don't match up quite right, but you get the idea, and with
tweaking it can be made to work.

<p>Speaking of the screws, I have another idea for the 2nd iteration. I was
looking at the 60mm fader, and I noticed that it has a little circuit board on
the bottom, and the circuit board is held tightly to the metal casing by little
metal tabs that are part of the casing, and folded over to hug the circuit
board.  Hmm. It occurs to me that I may not need all these screws, which it
turns out can be surprisingly expensive to source.  I can integrate some
plastic clips and ridges into the back side of the panel insert to allow the
faders to just be snapped into place.  Likewise, I can add some clips around
the edges of the panel inserts so they can just snap into the plywood control
panel.

<p>Came across this video of an interesting gauge:
<p align=center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fb_6pLyaG28" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It uses an X27-589 stepper motor (same as X27-168 but with pins on the front side).
Recommended stepper driver: Vid6606 (STI6606) 4x Stepper Driver for X27.168
<p>This solution appears to be quite expensive (for me), about $20 for the stepper motor
and $24 for the stepper motor driver. With manufactured PCBs, maybe it's around
$40-$50 per gauge.
<p>More ideas from this other video, some gauges using cheap servo motors:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib9axlfK0f4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib9axlfK0f4</a>

<b>Thu 08 Jun 2023 07:55:53 AM EDT</b>
<p>Implemented
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/discussions/334">an
idea by Shadow8472</a>, which is to allow running snis_client with no textures
(actually with 1 bogus textures).  Many of the stations (Navigation, Engineering
Damage Control, Science, and COMMs) do not use any textures. For phyiscal consoles
which are meant to be used with a single station, it doesn't make sense to load
all these textures only to not use any of them.  So I added a "--no-textures"
option to snis_client and an item in the "Options" menu of snis_launcher to
enable it.  Briefly observing the resident memory usage of snis_client with htop
showed it using about 700M with textures and about 300M without, saving 400M,
over half the memory used.

<p>Some notes about the shift register:
<pre>

       ---U---
   Qb -       - Vcc
   Qc -       - Qa
   Qd -       - SER   (DS)
   Qe -       - OE    (DE)
   Qf -       - RCLK  (ST_CP)
   Qg -       - SRCLK (SH_CP)
   Qh -       - SRCLR (MR)
  GND -       - Vcc
       -------

  Qa-Qh are outputs.
  OE is Output Enable.  It must be 0v to enable outputs. (tie to ground).
  SRCLR is Shift Register Clear, which clears the shift register
        when low.
  SER is the serial data input.
  SRCLK is the storage register clock
  RCLK is the register clock. I think this is a latch which makes this inputs appear
       on the outputs.  I *think* you can clock in 8 bits via SER and rising edge of
       SRCLK, then clock RCLK (rising edge) to have the outputs change all at once.
  SRCLR clears the shift register if low. I think I can just tie this to high.

<b>Sat Feb  8 10:00:38 EST 2020</b>
<p>Got my aviation style 3d printed switch case thing working pretty well.
<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4148488">Put it on Thingiverse</a>.

<p>The LEDs I'm using have a forward voltage of 3.0 to 3.2V.  Current should be 15-18mA,
and the power supply will be 12V DC.  So for resistor, I need:
<pre>
        R = (Vs - Vf) / If
          &gt;= (12 - 3.2) / 0.018
          &lt;= (12 - 3.0) / 0.015
          = 488.8-600 Ohm

    power = (12 - 3.0) *  0.018
          = 0.1628W (so, 1/4th watt resistor).
</pre>
That's for 1 LED, for 2 LEDs in series:
<pre>
        R = (Vs - Vf) / If
          &gt;= (12 - 3.2 - 3.2) / 0.018
          &lt;= (12 - 3.0 - 3.0) / 0.015
          = 311-400 Ohm

    power = (12 - 3.0 - 3.0) * 0.018
          = 0.108W (so, 1/4th watt resistor).
</pre>
So, for single LED, I need some 600 Ohm 1/4W resistors, and for double LEDs in series, 400 Ohm 1/4W resistors.

<p>Testing this out, it might be a little bright, so might need to up the resistor values, or put another
resistor in series with all the LEDs to drop the voltage down a bit. Experimenting, 5V with two LEDs just
barelly turns them on, 6V turns them on dimly, then the brightness ramps up as you crank the voltage up to
12V.  Probably 8 or 9V is about right.

<p>It seems that powering the Arduino via the Raspberry Pi's USB is fine, however, there's not a lot
of current available, so I will need to have another 5v power supply for powering LEDs.
<p>For switches, the lighted Apollo mission type switches are called
<a href="http://www.flamecorp.com/PDF/Safran-Electronics-Defense/Series%2090%20Catalog.pdf">Tellite switches</a>
and they are prohibitively expensive. However, I might be able to come up with a reasonable facsimile
using some cheap LEDs, laser cut acrylic and laser printed paper labels to fit over some cheap push buttons.

<p>Was talking with Rob last night at HackRVA, and we are going to build a vacuum forming
machine.  This should help with building the cases for the consoles.  I have a few ideas
about how to paint them.  One idea, vacuum form them from clear PETG, then paint the inside
with silver paint.  Should look like mylar, more or less.  Not sure I like that idea.  Another
idea, put some HVAC tape on select edges, paint with black, dark gray, or hammered metal, then
sand off a bit to expose some of the silver HVAC tape.  I think I'll probably do the latter
method.

<b>Sat Jan 25 19:38:29 EST 2020</b>
<p>Made some progress, there's a new program in the space-nerds-in-space repo called snis_arduino
that reads from the arduino and passes along commands from the arduino to snis_client.  I updated
the program which runs on the arduino itself (snis-console.c.ino) so it actually works.  The main
change I made was to switch to a text protocol from binary. This avoids de-syncing
as I can look for a newline to delimit the commands. Now the commands from the arduino to the
host (raspberry pi) are of the form: "#xxx=yyy\n", where xxx is the input number (0 - 31) and
yyy is the value for that input.  The values are only reported to the host if they differ from
the previous sampling by more than 3.

<p>Another change I made on the host side (snis_arduino) has to do with the problem I was seeing
in which it would read a little bit then quit upon encountering EOF.  It turns out that reading
from /dev/ttyACM0 is apparently non-blocking, despite not opening it with O_NONBLOCK, which
sort of surprises me.  So I changed the code to simply wait for a few milliseconds and try again
upon encountering EOF, and this seemed to make it work.

Here is rough drawing for a circuit for a station.  There are two 16 channel multiplexers
allowing for 32 potentiometers or switches.  The channels on the multiplexers are not
selected independently, but in parallel.  Two analog inputs on the arduino sample one
channel from each of the two multiplexers.

<p align=center><img src="snis-console-circuit-sketch-2020-01-22.jpg", width=85%>

<p>On the output side, two daisy chained shift registers allow up to 16 LEDs to be
controlled. Likely I will need to add NPN transistors to drive each of the LEDs to avoid
drawing too much current from the shift registers.

<p>Pseudocode for the arduino will be something along these lines:

<pre>

	static int new_value[32] = { 0 };
	static int old_value[32] = { 0 };
	static int led_status[16] = { 0 };

	setup()

		Set up 4 digital outputs D4 thru D7 for selecting the multiplexer channels.
		Set up 2 analog inputs for the multiplexer signals.
		Set up 3 digital outputs for the shift register controls
		set up interrupt handler for incoming serial data
	}

	select_multiplexer_channel(int n)
	{
		D4 = i &amp; 0x01;
		D5 = (i &gt;&gt; 1) & 0x01;
		D5 = (i &gt;&gt; 2) & 0x01;
		D5 = (i &gt;&gt; 3) & 0x01;
	}

	sample_inputs_from_multiplexer(int new_value[])
	{

		for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {
			select_multiplexer_channel(i);
			new_value[i] = read_multiplexer(0);
			new_value[i + 16] = read_multiplexer(1);
		}
	}

	transmit_changes(new_value, old_value)
	{
		for (i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++) {
			if (old_value[i] != new_value[i])
				transmit_value(i, new_value[i]);
		}
	}

	update_led_status()
	{
		/* Shift LED data out to shift register */
		for (i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {
			set DS = 0;
			set ST_CP = led_status[i];
			set DS = 1;
		}
		set DS = 0;

		/* Latch LED data (need to double check this is how it works) */
		set SH_CP = 0;
		set SH_CP = 1;
		set SH_CP = 0;
